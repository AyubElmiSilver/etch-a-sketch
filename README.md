# etch-a-sketch

This project will focus on building a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. The project will consolidate key knowledge of Javascript, Document Object Model, Flexbox, HTML and CSS. The project will be composed of sections listed down below.

The first section will be creating a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs and create a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them, leaving a pixelated trail through the grid.

The second section will involve adding a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before.

Lastly, set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100.
