# etch-a-sketch

This project will focus on building a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. The project will consolidate key knowledge of Javascript, Document Object Model, Flexbox, HTML and CSS. The project will be composed of multiple steps listed down below.

The first section will be creating a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs and create a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them, leaving a pixelated trail through the grid.
